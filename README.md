# Boston Housing Statistical Analysis 🏡📊

This project explores the **Boston Housing dataset** using **statistical tests and data visualization**.  
The analysis was done in Google Colab, and the notebook (`Boston_Housing_data.ipynb`) contains all code, plots, and interpretations.

## 📌 Project Overview
The aim of this project is to analyze the Boston Housing dataset and answer key research questions such as:
- What is the distribution of housing prices (MEDV)?
- Is there a significant difference in house values for tracts bounded by the Charles River?
- How do house prices vary across age groups of houses?
- Is there a correlation between nitric oxide concentrations (NOX) and industrial proportion (INDUS)?
- What is the impact of distance to employment centers (DIS) on house values?

## 🔍 Methods Used
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Histograms, Boxplots, Scatterplots
- **Statistical Tests**
  - T-test (independent samples)
  - ANOVA
  - Levene’s Test (homogeneity of variance)
  - Pearson Correlation
  - Regression Analysis

## 📊 Key Findings
- Housing prices are right-skewed with outliers above \$50,000 (capped).
- Houses near the Charles River tend to have higher median values.
- Older homes (70+ years) show lower median values compared to newer homes.
- Strong positive correlation between NOX and INDUS.
- Distance to employment centers (DIS) has a significant positive effect on house values.
